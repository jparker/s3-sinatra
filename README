This is a simple Sinatra application which demonstrates how to upload
a file directly to Amazon S3. Before it can be used a config.yml file
must be created which defines the following keys:

:access_key_id      => AWS access key id
:secret_access_key  => AWS secret access key
:bucket             => S3 bucket to upload to
:redirect_url       => URL to redirect to after successful upload

The config.yml settings can be defined at the top-level or they can be
namespaced under the name of the runtime environment much like the
database.yml file in a Rails project.
